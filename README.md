==============

A repository for a summer project on data analysis. Led by Yoav Freund UCSD.

An interesting way to publish a notebook to the world is by using a git Gist and 
the nbviewer service, such as so: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5856469

============
I have 4 files pushed to github: 
  1. poverty_data_tables
	2. povertytable
	3. restructured data.ods
	4. Poverty_Data_Tables.ipynb

povertytable was a preliminary attempt at outputting the data of w1010.txt to tables, it is outdated and is of no use anymore. 

restructured data.ods was a spreadsheet showing the potential format for the tables containing the data of w1010.txt. It too is outdated and is of no use anymore. 

poverty_data_tables is the current program outputting the data of w1010.txt intotabular format. It is still a work in progress; however, it is vastly superior to povertytable. 

Poverty_Data_Tables.ipynb is simply the ipython notebook version of poverty_data_tables.
